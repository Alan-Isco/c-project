This is a simple movie review application written in C programming language. 
The program allows a user to write a review of any movie anonymously and rate the movie on a scale of 1 to 5. 
The program provides a menu for the user to choose between reviewing a movie, seeing all the reviews, or exiting the program. 
The movie review input process prompts the user to enter the movie title and the number of lines of the review, and then allows them to input each line of the review. 
The program then writes the review and rating to a file called "reviews.txt". 
The program is written using functions such as "welcome", "review", "rating", "seeReviews", and "rates".
